      He started selling me on the screen quality, saying it had a better screen than any other tablet. I asked, “What do you mean? Which other tablets?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I couldn’t get him to say “iPad”, but he did say it was better than “Retina screens”.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I broke character slightly. “I don’t know, I saw the Retina iPad upstairs and I can’t see the pixels at all on it. On here, I can see the pixels clearly.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No you can’t. Where can you see the individual pixels?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Right there. See, the left stroke on that capital ‘D’ has one solid pixel on the left and a half-shaded pixel on the right.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      He scaled the icon up to “zoom in”, which, of course, changes what the physical pixels display. “I can’t see any pixels!”
