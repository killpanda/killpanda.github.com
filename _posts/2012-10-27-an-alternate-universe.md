```
He started selling me on the screen quality, saying it had a better screen than any other tablet. I asked, “What do you mean? Which other tablets?”
I couldn’t get him to say “iPad”, but he did say it was better than “Retina screens”.
I broke character slightly. “I don’t know, I saw the Retina iPad upstairs and I can’t see the pixels at all on it. On here, I can see the pixels clearly.”
“No you can’t. Where can you see the individual pixels?”
“Right there. See, the left stroke on that capital ‘D’ has one solid pixel on the left and a half-shaded pixel on the right.”
He scaled the icon up to “zoom in”, which, of course, changes what the physical pixels display. “I can’t see any pixels!”
