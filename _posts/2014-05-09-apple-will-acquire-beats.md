Apple nears acquire Beats for 3.2 billion. And this acquisition is agreed by both company.

Though I don't get why Apple will acquire another company with mature market and user group, but there is some my thoughts:

*   Beats could enhance the ID team and bring some new design languages and fresh blood to Apple

*   Beats&#8217; streaming service could help iTunes Radio

*   Beats marketing people could help Apple to become a luxury brand.

*   Beats is making money

But one thing makes me confused is that Apple usually tend to acquisition small companies which is not targeting massive consumer market, so that Apple doesn&#8217;t need to keep those products. By contrary, when Apple acquire Beats, Beats will keep running as it is so influential. So maybe Apple only wants another branch to mitigate risks in the future.
