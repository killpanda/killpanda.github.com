MetroTwit, the best Twitter Client, has been discontinued on Window Platform discontinued.
Due to the “access token limit” imposed by Twitter since August 2012, we are preemptively sunsetting MetroTwit due to technical limitations of Twitter’s API which may prevent existing users from accessing the app after the limit has been crossed.
